## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Setup

**Prerequisites:**

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (default workflow), **or** native installations of `postgresql` (providing `pg_ctl`, `pg_isready`, `initdb`) and `redis` (`redis-server`, `redis-cli`).

```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/decarvalhoe/trading-bot-open-source.git
cd trading-bot-open-source

# 2. Install development tools
make setup

# 3. Start the development environment (Docker)
make dev-up

# 4. Check that everything is working (auth-service health)
curl http://localhost:8011/health

# 5. Stop the environment
make dev-down
```

### Native (host) development

The default `.env.dev` assumes every dependency runs inside Docker. When you
prefer to run PostgreSQL/Redis/RabbitMQ directly on your machine, switch to the
native configuration helpers:

```bash
# Point the stack at localhost services
export $(cat .env.native | grep -v '^#' | xargs)

# Make sure ENVIRONMENT=native so shared helpers hand out localhost URLs
echo $ENVIRONMENT  # native

# Apply the latest migrations against your host database
scripts/run_migrations.sh
```

Both the configuration service and the shared helpers use the
`ENVIRONMENT` flag to pick the right `.env.<env>` file and config JSON. Setting
`ENVIRONMENT=native` automatically rewrites DSNs such as `POSTGRES_DSN`,
`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL` and `RABBITMQ_URL` to target `localhost` while the
Docker-based environments keep pointing at the internal container hostnames.

### Demo Trading Stack

To explore the monitoring and alerting services together, start the full demo stack:

```bash
make demo-up
```

The command builds the additional FastAPI services, applies Alembic migrations and wires Redis/PostgreSQL before exposing the following ports. Enable the optional AI strategy assistant and connectors with:

```bash
pip install -r services/algo_engine/requirements.txt
# Assistant runs by default once the optional dependencies are installed.
# Export AI_ASSISTANT_ENABLED=0 to opt out if you prefer to keep it disabled.
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
```

> ℹ️ Installing `services/algo_engine/requirements.txt` only makes the assistant
> dependencies available; the runtime flag `AI_ASSISTANT_ENABLED` (read in
> [`services/algo_engine/app/main.py`](services/algo_engine/app/main.py))
> controls whether the feature starts. Leave it unset for the default enabled
> behaviour or export `AI_ASSISTANT_ENABLED=0` to disable it even with the
> dependencies present.

**Available Services:**
- `8005` — `billing-service` (Stripe-style subscription orchestration and webhook replay tools)
- `8013` — `order-router` (execution plans and simulated brokers)
- `8014` — `algo-engine` (strategy catalogue, backtesting, optional AI assistant on `/strategies/generate`)
- `8015` — `market_data` (spot quotes, orderbooks and TradingView webhooks)
- `8016` — `reports` (risk reports and PDF generation)
- `8017` — `alert_engine` (rule evaluation with streaming ingestion)
- `8018` — `notification-service` (alert delivery history)
- `8019` — `streaming` (room ingest + WebSocket fan-out)
- `8020` — `streaming_gateway` (overlay OAuth flows and TradingView bridge)
- `8021` — `inplay` (watchlist WebSocket updates)
- `8022` — `web-dashboard` (HTML dashboard backed by reports + alerts APIs)

Generated artefacts are stored in `data/generated-reports/` (PDF exports) and `data/alert-events/` (shared SQLite database for alerts history). Default service tokens (`reports-token`, `inplay-token`, `demo-alerts-token`) and external API secrets can be overridden through environment variables before running the stack.

Stop every container with:

```bash
make demo-down
```

### Bootstrap the End-to-End Flow

Once the stack is running you can exercise the full onboarding → trading journey with the helper script:

```bash
scripts/dev/bootstrap_demo.py BTCUSDT 0.25 --order-type market
```

The command provisions a demo account, assigns entitlements, configures a strategy, routes an order, generates a PDF report, registers an alert, books a mock subscription in the billing API (available at `http://localhost:8005`) and publishes a streaming event. The emitted JSON summarises all created identifiers (user, strategy, order, alert, report location) together with the JWT tokens associated to the demo profile.

`scripts/dev/run_mvp_flow.py` now simply wraps this command for backward compatibility.

### Database Migrations

Use the Makefile helpers to manage Alembic migrations locally (the commands default to `postgresql+psycopg2://trading:trading@localhost:5432/trading`, override it with `ALEMBIC_DATABASE_URL=<your-url>` when needed):

```bash
# Generate a new revision
make migrate-generate message="add user preferences"

# Generate a trading revision directly with Alembic (autogenerates orders/executions models)
ALEMBIC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://trading:trading@localhost:5432/trading \
  alembic -c infra/migrations/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "add trading orders and executions tables"

# Apply migrations (defaults to head)
make migrate-up

# Roll back the previous revision (override DOWN_REVISION to target another one)
make migrate-down
```

> ℹ️ The Alembic environment dynamically imports multiple service packages (auth, user, market data, reports) so their SQLAlchemy metadata can be included in a single migration context. When running migrations outside Docker, install the service requirements first to ensure their dependencies (for example `email-validator`, `ib-async`, `weasyprint`) are available:
> ```bash
> pip install \
>   -r services/auth_service/requirements.txt \
>   -r services/user_service/requirements.txt \
>   -r services/market_data/requirements.txt \
>   -r services/reports/requirements.txt
> ```

Docker services now apply migrations automatically during startup through [`scripts/run_migrations.sh`](scripts/run_migrations.sh), ensuring the database schema is up to date before each application boots.
